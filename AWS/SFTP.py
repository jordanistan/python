# This code first configures the GitHub provider and retrieves the list of ssh keys from the specified gist. It then creates an IAM user and adds the ssh keys to the user using the aws_iam_access_key resource.

# Next, it creates an IAM group and adds the user to the group. Finally, it adds the required permissions to the group using the aws_iam_group_policy resource.

# Please note that this code assumes the existence of several variables, including github_token, gist_id, user_name, group_name, policy_name, and policy_json. You will need to set the values for these variables in order for the code to work properly.

# To write a Family Transfer in AWS in Terraform that reads the ssh keys from a list located in GitHub, you can use the following code:


# Configure the GitHub provider
provider "github" {
  token = var.github_token
}

# Retrieve the list of ssh keys from GitHub
data "github_gist" "ssh_keys" {
  gist_id = var.gist_id
}

# Create the IAM user
resource "aws_iam_user" "user" {
  name = var.user_name
}

# Add the ssh keys to the IAM user
resource "aws_iam_access_key" "ssh_keys" {
  count       = length(data.github_gist.ssh_keys.files["ssh_keys"].content)
  user        = aws_iam_user.user.name
  ssh_public_key = data.github_gist.ssh_keys.files["ssh_keys"].content[count.index]
}

# Create the IAM group and add the user to it
resource "aws_iam_group" "group" {
  name = var.group_name
  users = [aws_iam_user.user.name]
}

# Add the required permissions to the group
resource "aws_iam_group_policy" "policy" {
  name   = var.policy_name
  group  = aws_iam_group.group.name
  policy = var.policy_json
}
