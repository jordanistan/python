<!-- This policy allows the following actions:

rds:CreateDBInstance, rds:DescribeDBInstances, rds:ModifyDBInstance, and rds:DeleteDBInstance: create, describe, modify, and delete RDS database instances.
ec2:RunInstances, ec2:DescribeInstances, ec2:TerminateInstances, ec2:RebootInstances, ec2:StopInstances, and ec2:StartInstances: create, describe, terminate, reboot, stop, and start EC2 instances.
lambda:CreateFunction, lambda:ListFunctions, lambda:UpdateFunctionCode, lambda:UpdateFunctionConfiguration, and lambda:DeleteFunction: create, list, update the code and configuration, and delete Lambda functions.
The Resource property specifies the resources that these actions can be performed on. In this case, the * wildcard indicates that these actions can be performed on all RDS database instances, EC2 instances, and Lambda functions.

To use this policy, you will need to create a new IAM policy and paste the above JSON into the policy document. You can then attach the policy to an IAM user, group, or role to grant the specified permissions.

Here is an AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy that grants create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) access to a database, EC2 instances, Lambda functions, and Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS) instances to a specific user: -->
