<!-- This policy grants the data scientist access to a variety of AWS services and actions that are commonly used for data analysis and visualization. It allows the data scientist to list and retrieve data from S3 buckets, create and manage Glue resources, create and manage Redshift clusters, create and publish QuickSight dashboards, run Athena queries, monitor and log application performance with CloudWatch, create and manage EC2 instances, and create and manage Lambda functions.

Please note that this policy is just a starting point, and you may need to modify it to fit your specific requirements. For example, you may want to restrict the data scientist's access to certain resources or actions, or require MFA authentication for certain sensitive actions. It is important to carefully consider the permissions you grant to your data scientists to ensure the security and integrity of your AWS account. -->
