# This policy allows the user to perform the s3:PutObject action on all objects in the user-folder bucket, but denies the s3:DeleteObject action on all objects in the same bucket. This will allow the user to upload to the root of their folder, but not delete any objects.

# Please note that you will need to replace "user-folder" with the actual name of your S3 bucket. Also, you may need to modify the policy to fit your specific requirements. For example, you may want to allow the user to delete certain types of objects, or restrict their access to a specific folder within the bucket.

# To write an AWS IAM policy that allows a user to upload to the root of their folder but not delete anything, you can use the following policy:

{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": ["s3:PutObject"],
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::user-folder/*"
    },
    {
      "Effect": "Deny",
      "Action": ["s3:DeleteObject"],
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::user-folder/*"
    }
  ]
}
