# Here is a Python script that installs the Pritunl VPN software on an Amazon Web Services (AWS) instance:
import subprocess

def install_pritunl():
  # Update the package manager
  subprocess.run(["apt-get", "update"])

  # Install the Pritunl repository key
  subprocess.run(["wget", "-O", "-", "https://repo.pritunl.com/stable/apt/key.gpg | apt-key add -"])

  # Add the Pritunl repository to the sources list
  with open("/etc/apt/sources.list.d/pritunl.list", "w") as f:
    f.write("deb https://repo.pritunl.com/stable/apt bionic main")

  # Update the package manager
  subprocess.run(["apt-get", "update"])

  # Install Pritunl
  subprocess.run(["apt-get", "install", "-y", "pritunl"])

if __name__ == "__main__":
  install_pritunl()

# This script defines a function called install_pritunl that updates the package manager, installs the Pritunl repository key, adds the Pritunl repository to the sources list, and finally installs the Pritunl software.

# To run this script, you will need to have Python 3 installed on your AWS instance and have the subprocess module available. You can use the pip package manager to install the subprocess module if it is not already installed.
