ninja=f"Dark smoke fills the scene and pump up music slowly gets louder. \
The audience sees a ninja and his {describelook} {relashionship} {action} at a super expensive restaurant \
The {relashionship} is so hot that steam is coming out of her {bodypart} \
Some old {idoit} is sitting by the couple. The {idoit} is giving the {relashionship} the eye and popping like 16 boners. \
But the ninja sees the boners and the music really pumps up. The audience knows this guy is dead meat for sure. \
But out of nowhere, the old {idoit} pulls off his jacket to show that he is a pirate with {weapon} and everything. \
The ninja is like yeah right who cares and then pops the biggest boner ever, bigger than the biggest blackest boner alive. \
The ninja's boner smashes the entire restaurant.  Every single one of the pirate's boners explodes while making a {sound} sound. \
The ninja looks back at his {relashionship}.  She smiles and they pork."
