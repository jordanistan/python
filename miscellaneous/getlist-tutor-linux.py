# To write a Python script to search Google for jobs for tutoring Linux and export the results to a CSV file, you can use the google-api-python-client library to query the Google Custom Search API and the csv library to write the results to a CSV file. Here is an example of how you could do this:
# This script will send a GET request to the Google Custom Search API using the specified search query and CSE ID. The API will return a list of search results, which will then be written to a CSV file using the csv library.

# Note that you will need to obtain an API key and a CSE ID in order to use the Google Custom Search API. You can find more information about how to do this in the Google Custom Search documentation.

import googleapiclient.discovery
import csv

# Google API key
api_key = "YOUR_API_KEY"

# Function to search Google for jobs for tutoring Linux
def search_jobs():
  # Create a Google Custom Search client
  service = googleapiclient.discovery.build("customsearch", "v1", developerKey=api_key)

  # Set the search query to look for jobs for tutoring Linux
  query = "tutoring Linux jobs"

  # Send a GET request to the Google Custom Search API
  response = service.cse().list(q=query, cx="YOUR_CSE_ID").execute()

  # Return the search results
  return response["items"]

# Function to write the search results to a CSV file
def write_to_csv(results):
  # Open a CSV file in write mode
  with open("jobs.csv", "w", newline="") as csv_file:
    # Create a CSV writer
    writer = csv.writer(csv_file)

    # Write the headers to the CSV file
    writer.writerow(["Title", "Link", "Description"])

    # Write each search result to the CSV file
    for result in results:
      writer.writerow([result["title"], result["link"], result["snippet"]])

# Call the search_jobs function to get the search results
results = search_jobs()

# Call the write_to_csv function to write the search results to a CSV file
write_to_csv(results)
