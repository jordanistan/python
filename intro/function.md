<!-- n these examples, the first function, add, takes two arguments and returns their sum. The second function, greeting, takes no arguments and returns a string. The third function, list_sum, takes a list and returns the sum of its elements. The fourth function, get_value, takes a dictionary and a key, and returns the value of the given key. The fifth function, split_words, takes a string and returns a list of its words.

Here is an example of how to define a function in Python, along with five examples of different types of functions: -->

```python
# Define a function that takes two arguments and returns their sum
def add(x, y):
  return x + y

# Define a function that takes no arguments and returns a string
def greeting():
  return "Hello, World!"

# Define a function that takes a list and returns the sum of its elements
def list_sum(numbers):
  total = 0
  for number in numbers:
    total += number
  return total

# Define a function that takes a dictionary and returns the value of a given key
def get_value(dictionary, key):
  return dictionary[key]

# Define a function that takes a string and returns a list of its words
def split_words(string):
  return string.split()
```
