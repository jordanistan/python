What inspired you to work with Terraform for infrastructure as code?
Answer: I was drawn to Terraform because of its simplicity and the ability to manage infrastructure in a descriptive manner using HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL).

Can you show us an example of how you use Terraform to deploy a virtual machine in Azure?
Answer: Sure, here is an example of deploying a virtual machine in Azure using Terraform:

```hcl
provider "azurerm" {
  version = "2.18.0"
}

resource "azurerm_resource_group" "example" {
  name     = "example-group"

  address_space       = ["10.0.0.0/16"]
  location            = azurerm_resource_group.example.location
  resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.example.name
}

resource "azurerm_subnet" "example" {
  name                 = "example-subnet"
  resource_group_name  = azurerm_resource_group.example.name
  virtual_network_name = azurerm_virtual_network.example.name
  address_prefix       = "10.0.1.0/24"
}

resource "azurerm_network_interface" "example" {
  name                = "example-nic"
  location            = azurerm_resource_group.example.location
  resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.example.name

  ip_configuration {
    name                          = "example-config"
    subnet_id                     = azurerm_subnet.example.id
    private_ip_address_allocation = "dynamic"
  }
}

resource "azurerm_virtual_machine" "example" {
  name                  = "example-vm"
  location              = azurerm_resource_group.example.location
  resource_group_name   = azurerm_resource_group.example.name
  network_interface_ids = [azurerm_network_interface.example.id]
  vm_size               = "Standard_DS1_v2"

    managed_disk_type = "Standard_LRS"
  }

  storage_image_reference {
    publisher = "Canonical"
    offer     = "UbuntuServer"
    sku       = "20.04-LTS"
    version   = "latest"
  }

  os_profile {
    computer_name  = "example-vm"
    admin_username = "adminuser"
    admin_password = "P@ssw0rd1234"
  }

  os_profile_linux_config {
    disable_password_authentication = false
  }
}
```


Michelangelo: "Alright dudes and dudettes, let's get started with the first question. This one's about finding the most common element in a list."

Example code:

python
```python
def most_common_element(lst):
    # Create a dictionary to store the frequency of each element in the list
    frequency = {}
    for element in lst:
        if element in frequency:
            frequency[element] += 1
        else:
            frequency[element] = 1
    # Find the maximum frequency and return the corresponding element
    max_frequency = max(frequency.values())
    for element, count in frequency.items():
        if count == max_frequency:
            return element

# Test the function with a sample list
lst = [1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 4, 2]
print(most_common_element(lst)) # Output: 2
```

Donatello: "Next up, we have a question about reversing a string."

Example code:

php
```python
def reverse_string(string):
    # Create an empty string to store the reversed string
    reversed_string = ""
    # Iterate through the original string in reverse order, adding each character to the new string
    for i in range(len(string) - 1, -1, -1):
        reversed_string += string[i]
    # Return the new string
    return reversed_string
```

# Test the function with a sample string
string = "Hello, World!"
print(reverse_string(string)) # Output: "!dlroW ,olleH"
Leonardo: "The third question is about finding the first non-repeated character in a string."

Example code:

vbnet
```python
def first_non_repeated(string):
    # Create two dictionaries to store the frequency of each character and its first occurrence
    frequency = {}
    first_occurrence = {}
    for i, char in enumerate(string):
        if char in frequency:
            frequency[char] += 1
        else:
            frequency[char] = 1
            first_occurrence[char] = i
    # Iterate through the string again, checking if the frequency of each character is 1
    for char, count in frequency.items():
        if count == 1:
            return string[first_occurrence[char]]
    # Return None if there's no non-repeated character
    return None
```

# Test the function with a sample string
string = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
print(first_non_repeated(string)) # Output: "a"
Raphael: "Question four is about checking if a string is a palindrome."

Example code:

sql
```python
def is_palindrome(string):
    # Compare the first and last characters of the string
    left = 0
    right = len(string) - 1
    while left < right:
        if string[left] != string[right]:
            return False
        left += 1
        right -= 1
    # Return True if the string is a palindrome
    return True
```
# Test the function with a sample string
string = "racecar"
print(is_palindrome(string)) # Output: True

Splinter: "And finally, the hardest question of all. This one's about finding the longest common subsequence of two strings."

Example code:

```python
def longest_common_subsequence(string1, string2):
    # Create a 2D array to store the length of the longest common subsequence up to that point
    dp = [[0 for _ in range(len(string2) + 1)] for _ in range(len(string1) + 1)]
    # Fill in the array using dynamic programming
    for i in range(1, len(string1) + 1):
        for j in range(1, len(string2) + 1):
            if string1[i - 1] == string2[j - 1]:
                dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1] + 1
            else:

    # Backtrack through the array to find the actual subsequence
    i = len(string1)
    j = len(string2)
    while i > 0 and j > 0:
        if string1[i - 1] == string2[j - 1]:
            common_subsequence = string1[i - 1] + common_subsequence
            i -= 1

        else:
            j -= 1
    # Return the longest common subsequence
    return common_subsequence

# Test the function with sample strings
string1 = "AGCAT"
string2 = "GAC"
print(longest_common_subsequence(string1, string2)) # Output: "GAC"

```
Casey Jones: "And here's a bonus question from me. This one's about finding the longest increasing subsequence of a list."

Example code:


```python
def longest_increasing_subsequence(lst):
    # Create a list to store the length of the longest increasing subsequence ending at that index
    dp = [1 for _ in range(len(lst))]
    # Fill in the list using dynamic programming
    for i in range(1, len(lst)):
        for j in range(i):
            if lst[i] > lst[j]:
                dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)
    # Return the maximum value in the list
    return max(dp)

# Test the function with a sample list
lst = [10, 22, 9, 33, 21, 50, 41, 60]
print(longest_increasing_subsequence(lst)) # Output: 5

```

Michelangelo: "Next up, a classic interview question - finding the two numbers in a list that add up to a target sum."

Example code:

```python
def two_sum(lst, target):
    # Create a dictionary to store the difference between each number and the target
    differences = {}
    # Loop through the list
    for i, num in enumerate(lst):
        # Check if the difference between the target and the current number is in the dictionary
        if target - num in differences:
            # Return the indices of the two numbers
            return [differences[target - num], i]
        # Otherwise, add the current number to the dictionary
        differences[num] = i
    # If no two numbers add up to the target, return an empty list
    return []

# Test the function with a sample list and target
lst = [2, 7, 11, 15]
target = 9
print(two_sum(lst, target)) # Output: [0, 1]
```

Donatello: "Here's a question about finding the missing number in a range of numbers."

Example code:

```python
def missing_number(lst):
    # Get the expected sum of the range of numbers
    expected_sum = sum(range(1, len(lst) + 1))
    # Get the actual sum of the list
    actual_sum = sum(lst)

    return expected_sum - actual_sum

# Test the function with a sample list
lst = [1, 2, 4, 5, 6]
print(missing_number(lst)) # Output: 3
```

Leonardo: "Next, a question about checking if a binary tree is balanced."

Example code:

```python

        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

def is_balanced(root):
    # A helper function to get the height of a node in the tree
    def height(node):

        if left_height == -1 or right_height == -1:
            return -1
        # If the difference in height between the left and right subtrees is greater than 1, return -1 to indicate that the tree is not balanced
        if abs(left_height - right_height) > 1:
            return -1
        # Otherwise, return the height of the node as the maximum height of its left and right subtrees plus 1
        return max(left_height, right_height) + 1

    # Return True if the height of the root is not -1, indicating that the tree is balanced
    return height(root) != -1

# Test the function with a sample tree
root = TreeNode(1, TreeNode(2, TreeNode(4), TreeNode(5)), TreeNode(3, None, TreeNode(6)))
print(is_balanced(root)) # Output: True
```

Raphael: "Now let's look at a question about finding the longest common prefix in an array of strings."

Example code:

```python
def longest_common_prefix(strs):
    # If the list of strings is empty, return an empty string
    if not strs:
        return ""
    # Get the length of the shortest string in the list
    shortest_len = min([len(s) for s in strs])
    # Loop through the characters of the shortest string
    for i in range(shortest_len):
        # Loop through the strings in the list

    return strs[0][:shortest_len]

# Test the function with a sample list of strings
strs = ["hello", "helmet", "helix"]
print(longest_common_prefix(strs)) # Output: "hel"
```

Splinter: "Finally, a question about finding the minimum number of coins needed to make a certain amount of change."

Example code:
