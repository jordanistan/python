Introduction to Sorting Algorithms in Python

## Lesson 1: Introduction to Sorting Algorithms

What are sorting algorithms and why are they important
Types of sorting algorithms (e.g. bubble sort, insertion sort, selection sort, etc.)
## Lesson 2: Bubble sort

How bubble sort works

```python
def bubble_sort(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(0, n-i-1):
            if arr[j] > arr[j+1]:
                arr[j], arr[j+1] = arr[j+1], arr[j]
    return arr
```

Implementing bubble sort in Python
```python
bubble_sort([5,4,3,2,1])
Time and space complexity of bubble sort
Best case: O(n)
Average case: O(n^2)
Worst case: O(n^2)
```

## Lesson 3: insertion sort

How insertion sort works
```python
def insertion_sort(arr):
    for i in range(1, len(arr)):
        key = arr[i]
        j = i-1
        while j >=0 and key < arr[j] :
                arr[j + 1] = arr[j]
                j -= 1
        arr[j + 1] = key
    return arr
```

Implementing insertion sort in Python
```python
insertion_sort([5,4,3,2,1])
Time and space complexity of insertion sort
Best case: O(n)
Average case: O(n^2)
Worst case: O(n^2)
```

## Lesson 4: selection sort

How selection sort works
```python
def selection_sort(arr):
    for i in range(len(arr)):
        min_idx = i
        for j in range(i+1, len(arr)):
            if arr[min_idx] > arr[j]:
                min_idx = j
        arr[i], arr[min_idx] = arr[min_idx], arr[i]
    return arr
```

Implementing selection sort in Python
```python
selection_sort([5,4,3,2,1])
Time and space complexity of selection sort
Best case: O(n^2)
Average case: O(n^2)
Worst case: O(n^2)
```

## Lesson 5 (Continued): merge sort


```python
        while i < len(L):
            arr[k] = L[i]
            i += 1
            k += 1
        while j < len(R):
            arr[k] = R[j]
            j += 1
            k += 1
    return arr
```

Implementing merge sort in Python

```python
merge_sort([5,4,3,2,1])
Time and space complexity of merge sort
Best case: O(nlogn)
Average case: O(nlogn)
Worst case: O(nlogn)
```

## Lesson 6: quick sort

How quick sort works

```python
def partition(arr,low,high):
    i = ( low-1 )        
    pivot = arr[high]    
    for j in range(low , high):
        if   arr[j] <= pivot:
            i = i+1
            arr[i],arr[j] = arr[j],arr[i]
    arr[i+1],arr[high] = arr[high],arr[i+1]
    return ( i+1 )

def quickSort(arr,low,high):
    if low < high:
        pi = partition(arr,low,high)
        quickSort(arr, low, pi-1)
        quickSort(arr, pi+1, high)
    return arr
```

Implementing quick sort in Python

```python
quickSort([5,4,3,2,1], 0, 4)
Time and space complexity of quick sort
Best case: O(nlogn)
Average case: O(nlogn)
Worst case: O(n^2)
```
