## To get a valid API key and a search engine ID from Google, you can use the Google Custom Search Engine (CSE) API. Here is an example of how to create a custom search engine and obtain the API key and search engine ID using Python:

* Go to the Google Cloud Console and create a new project.

* Enable the Custom Search API for your project by clicking the "ENABLE APIS AND SERVICES" button and searching for "Custom Search API".

* Create a new custom search engine by visiting the Custom Search Engine control panel.

* Click the "Add" button to create a new search engine.

* Follow the prompts to configure your search engine. You can specify the websites that you want to include in the search, as well as any additional settings.

* Once you have created your custom search engine, click the "Search engine ID" link in the control panel to obtain your search engine ID.

* Go back to the Google Cloud Console and click the "Credentials" link in the left menu.

* Click the "Create credentials" button and select "API key".

* Your API key will be displayed on the next page. Make a note of the API key, as you will need it.
