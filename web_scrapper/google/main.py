# This code will perform a search for "cloud engineer jobs" and write the titles, URLs, and snippets of the top 10 search results to a CSV file called cloud_engineer_jobs.csv.
# To search Google for cloud engineer jobs and export the results to a CSV file, you can use the Python requests and csv libraries to send a GET request to Google's search API and write the results to a CSV file. However, please note that this requires you to have a valid API key and a search engine ID. You can obtain these by creating a custom search engine through the Google Custom Search Engine (CSE) API.

# Here is an example of how to search Google for cloud engineer jobs and export the results to a CSV file using Python:

import requests
import csv

# Replace YOUR_API_KEY and YOUR_SEARCH_ENGINE_ID with your own values
api_key = "YOUR_API_KEY"
search_engine_id = "YOUR_SEARCH_ENGINE_ID"

# Set the parameters for the search
query = "cloud engineer jobs"
num_results = 10

# Send the request to the Google CSE API
response = requests.get(
    "https://www.googleapis.com/customsearch/v1",
    params={
        "key": api_key,
        "cx": search_engine_id,
        "q": query,
        "num": num_results,
    },
)

# Write the search results to a CSV file
results = response.json()['items']
with open('cloud_engineer_jobs.csv', 'w', newline='') as csv_file:
    writer = csv.DictWriter(csv_file, fieldnames=['title', 'link', 'snippet'])
    writer.writeheader()
    for result in results:
        writer.writerow({
            'title': result['title'],
            'link': result['link'],
            'snippet': result['snippet'],
        })
